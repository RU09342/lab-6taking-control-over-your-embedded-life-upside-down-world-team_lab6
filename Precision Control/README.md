# Lab 6: Precision Control


## PWM Part 2
A circuit had to be built to handle a PWM wave input from the MSP430.  The circuit designed was an integrator to handle the AC wave.  The picture is attached named "Integrator Schematic."  ALl of the scopes are shown in a folder called "oscilliscope readings".  The input from the MSP430 is seen in scope 11.  The output would become a triangle wave since an integration was taken of the input.
