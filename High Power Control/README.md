# Lab 6: "High Power" Control
The purpose of this lab is to learn how to deal with high power and how to protect a microcontrollor when dealing with high power.  Nothing in this lab is high power but some things being used have the potential to damage or "brick" a microcontroller.  A 12V power supply is used in this lab with a power resistor attached to a red LED and another resistor attached to a green LED.  These LEDs will help indicate if the microcontroller is being used correctly.
